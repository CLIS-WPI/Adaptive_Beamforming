# Adaptive_Beamforming

**Adaptive Beamforming for Interference-Limited MU-MIMO using Spatio-Temporal Policy Networks**

This project introduces a machine learning‚Äìbased framework for receive-side beamforming in MU-MIMO wireless systems. It is designed for environments with partial Channel State Information (CSI), user mobility, and interference-limited conditions‚Äîcommon in consumer-grade Wi-Fi and 5G NR deployments.

The proposed method consists of:
- A **CNN-GRU encoder** that learns spatio-temporal CSI features.
- A **Reinforcement Learning (PPO) agent** that dynamically estimates a quantized combining matrix to maximize user SINR or throughput.

The system outperforms traditional methods like MRC, MMSE, and RBD by adaptively learning from past channel conditions and generalizing across time-varying environments.
